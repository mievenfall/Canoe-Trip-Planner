# Recursive Formula:
Let optimalCosts[i][j] be the optimal cost of traveling from post i to post j.
The recursive formula to calculate optimalCosts[i][j] is as follows:

optimalCosts[i][j] = min(optimalCosts[i][k] + optimalCosts[k][j], costMatrix[i][j]) for all i < k < j

The base case is when i == j, in which case optimalCosts[i][j] = 0.

# Theoretical Runtime Analysis:
The dynamic programming solution fills the optimalCosts matrix using a bottom-up approach. The size of the optimalCosts matrix is n x n, where n is the number of posts.

The outer loop iterates over different lengths (len) from 2 to n, representing the distance between posts. For each length, we iterate over all possible starting positions (i) from 0 to n - len. 

Inside the inner loop, we iterate over all possible intermediate posts (k) between i and j to find the optimal cost. This takes O(n) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3), as there are three nested loops, each iterating at most n times.

The space complexity is O(n^2) to store the optimalCosts matrix.
